2. **Install ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**  
   Download and install the official [Android SDK Platform Tools (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).  
   Make sure `adb` is available in your system PATH.

   Allow USB debugging authorization when prompted.

5. **Run Streamify on Your PC**  
   - Launch the Streamify desktop app.  
   - On first launch, it will automatically install the Streamify Android client on your device via ADB.

6. **Grant Permissions on Your Phone**  
   When the Streamify app opens on your Android device, grant the **screen sharing permission** in the pop-up dialog.

7. **Start Streaming**
